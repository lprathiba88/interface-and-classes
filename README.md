#### Interface And Classes

### April 6, 2016

Part 1:
Interfaces:
Create the IShape Class with following memebrs (properties and behaviors). Properties can not be added directly to interfaces so you'll want to review how to go about adding them:

Members:

- Properties/ Fields/ Instance Variables:

String name (any name you may give the instance - ex: "My First Shape")
String type (the type of shape - ex: circle, square, rectangle, triangle)
String color
int numSides
boolean eclipse

- Functions/Methods:

double calcArea();
double calcPerimeter();

Part 2:
Implementation:
Create two classes which implement the IShape Class, Circle and Square.
*Override the toString method and Create the following constructors:

Default,
One that takes the name
One that takes all properties

* Git
* Java 7
* Maven
